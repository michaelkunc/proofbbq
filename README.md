# Proof BBQ

The proof is NOT in the pudding. The proof is in the BBQ. This is an app for BBQ enthusiasts who want to up their game.
Cooking is a game of managing variables. Temperature, cooking time, marinade time, ect. A lot of us thing we can 'wing it'.

Winging it is for the birds. Real pit bosses write stuff down and learn from successes and failures.

This app is designed to capture the relevant details of every cook. It allows easily retrieval of those details. If you wanna see what happened the last time you whipped up a Boston Butt, this is the app for you. You can see temp, cooking time, pictures, notes. When it comes to making BBQ, leave the guesswork out. Easily see what worked, and what didn't and build those skills.

We here at Proof have a slogan: "Making the world safe for BBQ." Join us in our quest.
